<h1 align="center">Piscine-Java</h1>

This repository contains my solutions for the Piscine-Java, a series of exercises designed to teach and master the fundamental and advanced concepts of 
[Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) using [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).
Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

## About the piscine    
The goal of this piscine is to build a solid foundation in ``OOP`` using ``Java`` by solving practical problems of increasing complexity. Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise targeting one or more key concepts of the language.
